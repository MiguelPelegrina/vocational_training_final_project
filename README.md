# Final project of vocational training

This project is a crucial part of my vocational training, serving as a necessary component for its completion. The application's primary goal is to provide an effortless way of managing household food storage, especially in large households where organization can be challenging. This app serves as a versatile tool that encompasses the following use cases:

- Create and share different storages among users.
- View, add, remove, and modify stored products, which can also be utilized for cooking recipes.
- Develop and share recipes with other users.
- Generate and share shopping lists with other storage users.
- Utilize a calendar feature to assign specific recipes to particular days.
- Perform CRUD operations for all storages, products, recipes, and shopping lists.

Each use case is designed to be user-friendly, flexible, and intuitive. For instance, users can effortlessly create shopping lists for specific recipes or days, and they can easily check the availability of recipes based on the contents of the storage.
